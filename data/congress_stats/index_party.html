<h2> Overall Personality Traits: Differences Between Democrats and Republicans</h2>
<p> Overall, Democrats and Republicans scored similarily on personality traits, and there are more differences within groups than between them.
  However, there were some differences between groups: </p>
  <li> In general, Democrats exhibited more negative traits on their twitter feeds.  We hypthesize that this may be due to being the 'out of power' part</li>
  <li> In this analysis, we used raw scores as opposed to percentiles, as the raw scores give a better represenation of true differences
  between groups. In the charts below, these differences roughly correlate with a 10% - 20% difference between groups</li>
